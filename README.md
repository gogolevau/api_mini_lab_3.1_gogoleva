Find out the fact about the number app.

How it works?

Server gets a request, handles it and then sends it to Numbers api,
receives a fact about random integer number, about random year, about random date, and sends it.

How to run app?

For this app you need to install node.js!

1)  To run this app localy, you need to clone repository
2)  Open terminal in folder with code files, and execute:
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start` â€” for run app in node.js
3)  Now we can use the app to send requests.

App logic

1)  On `/year` endpoint, app will send a fact about random year in json;

2)  On `/date` endpoint, app will send a fact about random date in json;

3)  On `/math` endpoint, app will send a fact about random number in json.
